# All Subsequences of Array in Java

This repository contains a Java program that recursively generates and returns all possible subsequences (subsets) of an integer array.

## Example

**Input:**  
`arr = {3, 1, 2}`

**Output:**
[3,1,2]
[3,1]
[3,2]
[3]
[1,2]
[1]
[2]
[]

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(2‚Åø √ó n)  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Stack: O(n)  
  - Result Storage: O(2‚Åø √ó n)

## How It Works

The function uses recursion to include and exclude each element, building all combinations while preserving order.


# Subsequence Sum K - Java

This Java program returns all subsequences (subsets) of an array whose sum is exactly equal to a given target value `k`, using recursion.

## üìå Example

**Input:**
```java
arr = {1, 2, 1}, k = 2
[1, 1]  
[2]
