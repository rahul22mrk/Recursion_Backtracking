# 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking – Java

This repository contains Java programs that solve classic **subsequence problems** using **recursion and backtracking**.

---

## 📁 Files Overview

1. `GenerateAllSubsequences.java`  
   ➤ Generate all possible subsequences of an array

2. `SubsequenceWithSumK.java`  
   ➤ Return all subsequences whose sum is equal to K

3. `OneSubsequenceWithSumK.java`  
   ➤ Return any one subsequence whose sum is equal to K

## ✅ Example Input

arr = {1, 2, 1}  
k = 2
