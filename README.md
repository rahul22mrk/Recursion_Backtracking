# 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking – Java

This repository contains Java programs that solve classic **subsequence problems** using **recursion and backtracking**.

## 📁 Files Overview

1. `GenerateAllSubsequences.java`  
   ➤ Generate all possible subsequences of an array

2. `SubsequenceWithSumK.java`  
   ➤ Return all subsequences whose sum is equal to K

3. `OneSubsequenceWithSumK.java`  
   ➤ Return any one subsequence whose sum is equal to K

4. `CountSubsequenceWithSumK.java`  
   ➤ Count total number of subsequences whose sum is equal to K

5. `RandomizedQuickSort.java`  
   ➤ Sort an array using Hoare's partition and random pivot (Quick Sort)
   
6. `MergeSort.java`  
   ➤ Sort an array using Merge Sort

7. `CombinationSum.java`  
   ➤ Find all combinations where elements (repeatedly used) sum up to a target value

8. `CombinationSum-II.java`  
   ➤  Find all **unique combinations** where each element is used **at most once** and the sum equals the target. Duplicates in input are handled gracefully to avoid duplicate combinations.

9. `SubsetSums.java`  
   ➤  Return the sum of all subsets of a given array using recursion.
